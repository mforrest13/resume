CV maintainance is one of these painful and repetitive tasks that you don't want to burn too much time on. For a while, I have been using latex with the excellent moderncv class, but the pdf format has annoying limitations:

Seeing a pdf document in a browser is not as nice as seeing an html webpage;
Human Resources usually prefer to work with word documents.
I thus decided to switch to the markdown syntax, and to generate various formats with pandoc.
